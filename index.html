<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p> Hi everyone, my name is Josh Brower. Thank you for visiting my website, I am in my last semester at the University of Minnesota studying technical writing and communication. I use this site as a way for people to view my writing and learn more about me. If you enjoy reading my work or have any input please feel free to send me an email or give me a call.

	<h2><center> About Me </center></h2>

<p> I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio and moved to St. Paul, Minnesota when I was 16. I would still consider Cleveland my home but I have grown to really like the Twin Cities  and decided to stay for College. I'm not sure where life will take me once I graduate but I am currently enjoying my time in Minnesota.

	<center>Interests</center>
</h2>
	

<p> 	I am a huge sports fan, especially baseball and football, but will watch 	pretty much anything that is on. Being from Cleveland, those are the teams I root for. I also enjoy playing video games and playing sports, like basketball or soccer, to stay in shape. I don't watch to many shows or movies since I often times lose interest mid way through and get bored, but I am a huge Seinfeld fan. I am very interested in art, especially modern art and have taken many art history classes. I also spend a lot of time reading and looking at architecture and fashion.
